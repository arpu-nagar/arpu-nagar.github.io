## But first, let's visit Connecticut

I arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport at 1:30 a.m. on December 21, 2023. It was bitterly cold, but the prospect of an exciting journey warmed me. I was going to meet my old friend Vrishabh at the airport, and we were going to his aunt's house, where we would stay until Christmas. It was late when we arrived in Connecticut, my fifth American state, and the country roads were silent and dark. I was greeted by the cutest fur babies, and I knew this Christmas would be memorable. We called it a day.


Aamod had driven all the way from Boston to join us. Here's what happened over the next few days:


1. Regular morning Dunkin runs
2. Exploring the surrounding areas of Redding, Connecticut.
3. Beer in the evenings, with special mention to the Redding Beer Company, a quaint, local brewery in town that served some incredible pours.

4. Late night screening of The Sopranos.
We took two road trips during the week.

One activity was a hike through the Minnewaska State Park Preserve. A breathtaking landscape, and with temperatures hovering around 40 degrees, it was ideal for hiking.

The other was to the Mohegan Sun, a castle of glass casino built on Indian land where I lost $80 but will not discuss it. I would just like to advise you readers to avoid playing Roulette or Slots at casinos in favor of more math-oriented games such as Poker or Blackjack.

I vividly recall the evening walks with the doggos, the freezing weather, and the stunning countryside.

## NEW YORK CITY

On Christmas afternoon, Vrishabh and I packed our bags and headed to NYC. We drove through Queens and reached Long Island City, my abode for the next two weeks. 

Alright are you guys ready for the adventures that happened next?

Christmas evening, my first time in New York City. Hunts afoot!
