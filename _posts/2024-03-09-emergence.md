### 1. Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been the center of a long-standing debate since the 1960s, with many different perspectives being proposed about its nature and its relationship to the human mind. 

Philosophers like Jerry Fodor have argued for the Computational Theory of Mind, Modularity, Nativism, and Representation Theory, which have greatly influenced the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive science. Their functionalist view, with the slogan "No computation without representation,"  asserts that mental processes are essentially computational and that they involve representing the world in some way.

On the other hand, John Searle's concept of intentionality highlights the inherent directedness of our thoughts and consciousness towards external entities or states of affairs. He emphasizes that our mental states inherently involve being "about" something, such as thinking about specific objects or situations. 

These philosophical theories were soon challenged by the findings of neuroscientists like Paul and Patricia Churchland, who were pioneers in neuroscience and advocated for studying the brain.

They were proponents of reductive materialism, which asserts that only the material world is accurate and that phenomena can be explained by reducing them to essential scientific components like atoms and molecules. Neuroscience had the potential to answer many of the questions that philosophers had about the mind, and it quickly gained popularity, leading to the emergence of the belief in "scientism,"  which is the belief that the only accurate explanations are scientific explanations.

However, these scientific explanations failed to account for internal states, first-person perspectives, and the subjective experience of being happy or seeing red. These aspects of the mind remained unexplained. The Chinese room argument and concept of a philosophical zombie.
