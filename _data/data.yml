    title: About me
    summary: |
      I'm a graduate student at the University of Florida, pursuing a Master's in Computer Science. My research interests include Machine Learning and Cognitive Science.
      <br><br>Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Oracle working on creating the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/construction-engineering/construction-intelligence-cloud/">Construction Intelligence Cloud</a>
      My work involves JS libraries like Oracle JET and low code platforms like Oracle APEX to create UI. I've also worked on backend and API development for the same product in Flask and later NodeJS. 
      <br><br>Prior to Oracle, I interned at <a href="https://www.sc.com/">Standard Chartered Bank</a> and <a href="https://forty4hz.com/">Forty4Hz</a>.
      My love for development comes from a vision to research, set up, and see projects through to completion.
      <br><br>In May 2021, I launched <a href="www.getmyvaccine.in">getmyvaccine.in</a> that helped 10,000+ people to get COVID vaccine appointments.
