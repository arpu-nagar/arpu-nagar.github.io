This is a bucket-list I've been making since I was 14 years old. The only rule here is, I can only add to this list and never remove any item from it.

1. Travel to every UN recognised country in the World. (Progress: 13/193)

2. Eat Kobe Beef in Japan with my friends Azi and Modi.

3. Swim from Maui - Lanai.

4. Complete a Triathlon.

5. Fly in a private jet.

6. Fly a helicopter.

7. Get into a bar fight.

8. Drink this cocktail alone [in Mexico](https://youtu.be/w_KkmaWoVZM).

9. Get a postcard worthy picture with Mt. Fuji in the background.

10. Try ayahuasca. (Synthetic DMT as well as raw in South America)

11. Live in New York City.

12. Get a job at FAANG.

13. Come clean to my parents one day.
