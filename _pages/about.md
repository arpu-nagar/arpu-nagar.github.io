I'm a graduate student at the University of Florida, pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science. My research interests include Machine Learning and Cognitive Science.
      <br><br>Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Oracle working on creating the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/construction-engineering/construction-intelligence-cloud/">Construction Intelligence Cloud</a>. I led the frontend for CIC Admin App.
      <br><br>Prior to Oracle, I interned at <a href="https://www.sc.com/">Standard Chartered Bank</a> and <a href="https://forty4hz.com/">Forty4Hz</a>. I graduated from Manipal Insitute of Technology with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
      My love for development comes from a vision to research, set up, and see projects through to completion.
      <br><br>In May 2021, I launched <a href="www.getmyvaccine.in">getmyvaccine.in</a> that helped 10,000+ people to get COVID vaccine appointments.
      <br><br> Here's my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18YWnhTpKPw2Pahnm-z6eK0ppkkLCLFvr/view?usp=sharing">Résumé</a>.
