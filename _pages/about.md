I'm a graduate student at the University of Florida, pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science. My research interests include <strong>Deep Learning, Generative AI and Image Analysis </strong>.  

I am currently a Software Engineering Intern at <a href="https://tesla.com">Tesla</a> working on the Digital Experience team.

At UF, I am affiliated with the <a href="https://ceecs.education.ufl.edu/">Anita Zucker Center for Childhood Excellence </a> as an Application Developer, working on a Geo-fencing android application to assist in developing Rich Language Behaviors (RLB) between parents and young children.
      <br><br>Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Oracle working on creating the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/construction-engineering/construction-intelligence-cloud/">Construction Intelligence Cloud</a>. I led the frontend for CIC Admin App.
      <br><br>Prior to Oracle, I interned at <a href="https://www.sc.com/">Standard Chartered Bank</a> and <a href="https://forty4hz.com/">Forty4Hz</a>. I graduated from Manipal Insitute of Technology with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
      My love for development comes from a vision to research, set up, and see projects through to completion.
      <br><br>In May 2021, I launched <a href="https://www.getmyvaccine.in">getmyvaccine.in</a> that helped 10,000+ people to get COVID vaccine appointments.
      <br><br>In my free time, I like reading sci-fi, discussing frontier research including that in conciousness and quantum mechanics. 
      <br><br>My role models include Roger Penrose, Nikola Tesla, Elon Musk and Mahatma Gandhi.
