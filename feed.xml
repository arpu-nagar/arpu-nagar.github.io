Introduction</h3> <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has been the center of a long-standing debate since the 1960s, with many different perspectives being proposed about its nature and its relationship to the human mind.</p> <p>Philosophers like Jerry Fodor have argued for the Computational Theory of Mind, Modularity, Nativism, and Representation Theory, which have greatly influenced the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive science. Their functionalist view, with the slogan ‚ÄúNo computation without representation,‚Äù asserts that mental processes are essentially computational and that they involve representing the world in some way.</p> <p>On the other hand, John Searle‚Äôs concept of intentionality highlights the inherent directedness of our thoughts and consciousness towards external entities or states of affairs. He emphasizes that our mental states inherently involve being ‚Äúabout‚Äù something, such as thinking about specific objects or situations.</p> <p>These philosophical theories were soon challenged by the findings of neuroscientists like Paul and Patricia Churchland, who were pioneers in neuroscience and advocated for studying the brain.</p> <p>They were proponents of reductive materialism, which asserts that only the material world is accurate and that phenomena can be explained by reducing them to essential scientific components like atoms and molecules. Neuroscience had the potential to answer many of the questions that philosophers had about the mind, and it quickly gained popularity, leading to the emergence of the belief in ‚Äúscientism,‚Äù which is the belief that the only accurate explanations are scientific explanations.</p> <p>However, these scientific explanations failed to account for internal states, first-person perspectives, and the subjective experience of being happy or seeing red. These aspects of the mind remained unexplained.

Kennedy International Airport at 1:30 a.m. on December 21, 2023. It was bitterly cold, but the prospect of an exciting journey warmed me. I was going to meet my old friend Vrishabh at the airport, and we were going to his aunt‚Äôs house, where we would stay until Christmas. It was late when we arrived in Connecticut, my fifth American state, and the country roads were silent and dark. I was greeted by the cutest fur babies, and I knew this Christmas would be memorable. We called it a day.</p> <p>Aamod had driven all the way from Boston to join us. Here‚Äôs what happened over the next few days:</p> <ol> <li>Regular morning Dunkin runs</li> <li>Exploring the surrounding areas of Redding, Connecticut.</li> <li>Beer in the evenings, with special mention to the Redding Beer Company, a quaint, local brewery in town that served some incredible pours.</li> </ol> <p><img src="/assets/img/nyc/redding.jpg" alt="Redding Beer Co."/></p> <center> Redding Beer Co., Redding, CT </center> <p><br/></p> <ol> <li>Late night screening of The Sopranos. We took two road trips during the week.</li> </ol> <p>One activity was a hike through the Minnewaska State Park Preserve. A breathtaking landscape, and with temperatures hovering around 40 degrees, it was ideal for hiking.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/nyc/minnewaska.JPG" alt="Drone shot"/></p> <center> Lake Minnewaska, NY </center> <p><br/></p> <p>The other was to the Mohegan Sun, a castle of glass casino built on Indian land where I lost $80 but will not discuss it. I would just like to advise you readers to avoid playing Roulette or Slots at casinos in favor of more math-oriented games such as Poker or Blackjack.</p> <p>I vividly recall the evening walks with the doggos, the freezing weather, and the stunning countryside.</p> <h2 id="new-york-city">NEW YORK CITY</h2> <p>On Christmas afternoon, Vrishabh and I packed our bags and headed to NYC. We drove through Queens and reached Long Island City, my abode for the next two weeks.</p> <p>Alright are you guys ready for the adventures that happened next?</p> <p>Christmas evening, my first time in New York City.

It would be my first time on the West Coast, which I was told was supposedly the <ins>best coast</ins>. I was excited to verify that claim. My time at the airport disappeared like a breeze, and I was aboard a 6-and-a-quarter-hour flight. Thankfully, I was assigned row 13 and had the whole row to myself. I reached SFO by 10:30, and I was in Sunnyvale about an hour past midnight. (due to a small pit stop at Apni Mandi)</p> <h3 id="a-day-in-the-life-of-a-tourist">A day in the life of a tourist:</h3> <p>Started off by visiting SF. I had a bagel for breakfast and really liked the garlic cream cheese. Our first stop was the iconic Lombard Street, followed by the Golden Gate Bridge. Next were Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf and Pier 39. SF is pretty fucked, and spots like Chinatown were filled with homeless, druggies, and hustlers, with most people being all three. I saw cars with pages stuck to rear windows, pleading with people not to break them. üòÇ</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/cali/golden_gate.jpg" alt="Golden Gate Bridge"/></p> <center> Every tech bro's pfp at some point </center> <p><br/></p> <p>We then headed back to South Bay and visited Stanford. Magnificent campus. After a long day of walking, we were exhausted and decided to relax and have dinner. We headed to the Westfield Valley Fair. I was pretty excited for Ramen Nagi (aka the best ramen in the world), as Ayush had hyped me up. The wait was an hour. While in line, we munched on a bag of fried mushrooms and Vietnamese iced coffee. Ayush had boba, which was tasteless. I had the regular, which was probably a Tonkatsu. It tasted great, and the spice was on point. We then did a little shopping and headed back.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/cali/stanford.jpg" alt="Golden Gate Bridge"/></p> <center> Stanford's iconic arches </center> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="road-trip-day">Road trip day!</h3> <p>We picked up some breakfast at In-N-Out. I, of course, had to have the double-double with grilled onions. Ayush had the grilled cheese, which isn‚Äôt on the menu, but you can order it (a nice little trick for vegetarians). The burger and fries were average but cheap compared to Five Guys or Shake Shack. We then drove through US-101S towards Monterey County. We joined the CA-1S highway and enjoyed the breathtaking views of the Pacific coastline. The route had patches where you could see the mountains on one side and the sea on the other. Truly mesmerizing. We headed to Big Sur and turned back to head back to the bay. Lastly, we ended our day with Pani Puri at Apni Mandi.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/cali/big_sur.jpg" alt="Big Sur" style="width:50rem;"/></p> <center> The Bixby Bridge, Big Sur, California </center> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="a-day-to-remember-indeed">A day to remember, indeed</h3> <p>Ayush and I went to visit the Google campuses in Sunnyvale. After a hearty breakfast, I got a chance to look around the buildings. I also rode a GBike. Later, Vrishabh called tech ‚ÄúAdult Day Care,‚Äù which I found particularly hilarious.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/cali/google.jpg" alt="Google" style="width:50rem;"/></p> <center> Preppy kid at the Google Bayview campus </center> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="helping-a-brother-out">Helping a brother out</h3> <p>After helping Ayush with some personal work, we had Chinese food for dinner. Xioalongbao and Sichuan noodles. Bliss. Also, a dejavu happened, and Ayush was utterly stunned. [There is more evidence that we live in a physical world guided by dynamic systems] (https://cogdev.sitehost.iu.edu/labwork/Smith_dynamicsystem_2005.pdf).</p> <h3 id="round-up">Round up</h3> <p>I visited the Computer History Museum. I fiddled around with the artifacts just like Alex had. Fun. I headed to SFO, and after bidding goodbye, I was off to JFK for the next part of my trip.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/cali/chm.jpg" alt="Computer History Museum" style="width:50rem;"/></p> <center> The Computer History Museum, Mountain View, California </center> <p><br/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="travel"/><category term="SF"/><category term="california"/><category term="travel"/><category term="bigsur"/><category term="google"/><category term="chm"/><category term="stanford"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An account of my trip to the Golden but not so Sunny State.]]></summary></entry></feed>
